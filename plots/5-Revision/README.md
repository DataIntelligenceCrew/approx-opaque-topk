This directory contains plots for ALL experiments ran for the revision. 
Each of the Synthetic, UsedCars, and ImageNet experiments were run in the same machine. 
Each config was repeated 10-25 times then the results were averaged per iteration. 
The plots are certainly less readable than the versions presented in the paper, as all information is included, including some configurations that did not fit into the paper. 
These are meant more as reference.
